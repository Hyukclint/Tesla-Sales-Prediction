# Tesla-Sales-Prediction
Sales Prediction of Tesla by using Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning through Python, Pytorch 

Accurate sales forecasting is a critical activity in the automotive industry, as it can unlock new sales opportunities while reducing losses from overproduction or underperformance. 

Using Python, I can easily share prediction models with colleagues or others interested in this domain. 
My current focus is on developing expertise in both machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy. 

The dataset includes monthly sales figures, Teslaâ€™s pricing, the number of charging stations across several countries, and various GDP metrics, which will be key factors in building robust models
